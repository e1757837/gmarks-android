More Details:

Automatically synchronize your Google Bookmarks to your phone!  Background sync means you're always up-to-date, but it only syncs what's changed.  Use GMarks for Firefox, the Google bookmarklet or the Google Toolbar to quickly send bookmarks to your phone.

Choose any label to synchronize with your Android Browser bookmarks.  This means you can backup and export your browser bookmarks across multiple devices.  

Live Folders give you quick access to any label.  Use it to create a reading list on your device!

Global Search integration means you can quickly find a bookmark using your device's Search button or the Google Search widget.  (You can enable this in the system settings under "Search.")  Full-text search indexes bookmark titles, labels, URLs and descriptions.  

Quickly create new Google Bookmarks from the browser's "Share" menu.

Secure: Your username and password are sent straight to Google, and are never read or stored by the GMarks app.  All internet requests use HTTPS/ SSL to ensure complete privacy.  GMarks also supports Google two-factor authentication (Since version 0.6.4.)  You must have the Google Authenticator app installed.
